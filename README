SYNOPSIS
      use HTML::StripScripts;

      my $hss = HTML::StripScripts->new({ Context => 'Inline' });

      $hss->input_start_document;

      $hss->input_start('<i>');
      $hss->input_text('hello, world!');
      $hss->input_end('</i>');

      $hss->input_end_document;

      print $hss->filtered_document;

DESCRIPTION
    This module strips scripting constructs out of HTML, leaving as much
    non-scripting markup in place as possible. This allows web applications
    to display HTML originating from an untrusted source without introducing
    XSS (cross site scripting) vulnerabilities.

    The process is based on whitelists of tags, attributes and attribute
    values. This approach is the most secure against disguised scripting
    constructs hidden in malicious HTML documents.

    As well as removing scripting constructs, this module ensures that there
    is a matching end for each start tag, and that the tags are properly
    nested.

    The HTML document must be parsed into start tags, end tags and text
    before it can be filtered by this module. Use either
    HTML::StripScripts::Parser or HTML::StripScripts::Regex instead if you
    want to input an unparsed HTML document.

CONSTRUCTORS
    new ( CONFIG )
        Creates a new "HTML::StripScripts" filter object, bound to a
        particular filtering policy. If present, the CONFIG parameter must
        be a hashref. The following keys are recognized (unrecognized keys
        will be silently ignored).

        "Context"
            A string specifying the context in which the filtered document
            will be used. This influences the set of tags that will be
            allowed.

            If present, the "Context" value must be one of:

            "Document"
                If "Context" is "Document" then the filter will allow a full
                HTML document, including the "HTML" tag and "HEAD" and
                "BODY" sections.

            "Flow"
                If "Context" is "Flow" then most of the cosmetic tags that
                one would expect to find in a document body are allowed,
                including lists and tables but not including forms.

            "Inline"
                If "Context" is "Inline" then only inline tags such as "B"
                and "FONT" are allowed.

            "NoTags"
                If "Context" is "NoTags" then no tags are allowed.

            The default "Context" value is "Flow".

        "BanList"
            If present, this option must be a hashref. Any tag that would
            normally be allowed (because it presents no XSS hazard) will be
            blocked if the lowercase name of the tag is a key in this hash.

            For example, in a guestbook application where "HR" tags are used
            to separate posts, you may wish to prevent posts from including
            "HR" tags, even though "HR" is not an XSS risk.

        "BanAllBut"
            If present, this option must be reference to an array holding a
            list of lowercase tag names. This has the effect of adding all
            but the listed tags to the ban list, so that only those tags
            listed will be allowed.

        "AllowSrc"
            By default, the filter won't allow constructs that cause the
            browser to fetch things automatically, such as "SRC" attributes
            in "IMG" tags. If this option is present and true then those
            constructs will be allowed.

        "AllowHref"
            By default, the filter won't allow constructs that cause the
            browser to fetch things if the user clicks on something, such as
            the "HREF" attribute in "A" tags. Set this option to a true
            value to allow this type of construct.

METHODS
    This class provides the following methods:

    input_start_document ()
        This method initializes the filter, and must be called once before
        starting on each HTML document to be filtered.

    input_start ( TEXT )
        Handles a start tag from the input document. TEXT must be the full
        text of the tag, including angle-brackets.

    input_end ( TEXT )
        Handles an end tag from the input document. TEXT must be the full
        text of the end tag, including angle-brackets.

    input_text ( TEXT )
        Handles some non-tag text from the input document.

    input_process ( TEXT )
        Handles a processing instruction from the input document.

    input_comment ( TEXT )
        Handles an HTML comment from the input document.

    input_declaration ( TEXT )
        Handles an declaration from the input document.

    input_end_document ()
        Call this method to signal the end of the input document.

    filtered_document ()
        Returns the filtered document as a string.

SUBCLASSING
    The "HTML::StripScripts" class is subclassable. Filter objects are plain
    hashes and "HTML::StripScripts" reserves only hash keys that start with
    "_hss". The filter configuration can be set up by invoking the
    hss_init() method, which takes the same arguments as new().

OUTPUT METHODS
    The filter outputs a stream of start tags, end tags, text, comments,
    declarations and processing instructions, via the following "output_*"
    methods. Subclasses may override these to intercept the filter output.

    The default implementations of the "output_*" methods pass the text on
    to the output() method. The default implementation of the output()
    method appends the text to a string, which can be fetched with the
    filtered_document() method once processing is complete.

    If the output() method or the individual "output_*" methods are
    overridden in a subclass, then filtered_document() will not work in that
    subclass.

    output_start_document ()
        This method gets called once at the start of each HTML document
        passed through the filter. The default implementation does nothing.

    output_end_document ()
        This method gets called once at the end of each HTML document passed
        through the filter. The default implementation does nothing.

    output_start ( TEXT )
        This method is used to output a filtered start tag.

    output_end ( TEXT )
        This method is used to output a filtered end tag.

    output_text ( TEXT )
        This method is used to output some filtered non-tag text.

    output_declaration ( TEXT )
        This method is used to output a filtered declaration.

    output_comment ( TEXT )
        This method is used to output a filtered HTML comment.

    output_process ( TEXT )
        This method is used to output a filtered processing instruction.

    output ( TEXT )
        This method is invoked by all of the default "output_*" methods. The
        default implementation appends the text to the string that the
        filtered_document() method will return.

REJECT METHODS
    When the filter encounters something in the input document which it
    cannot transform into an acceptable construct, it invokes one of the
    following "reject_*" methods to put something in the output document to
    take the place of the unacceptable construct.

    The TEXT parameter is the full text of the unacceptable construct.

    The default implementations of these methods output an HTML comment
    containing the text "filtered".

    Subclasses may override these methods, but should exercise caution. The
    TEXT parameter is unfiltered input and may contain malicious constructs.

    reject_start ( TEXT )
    reject_end ( TEXT )
    reject_text ( TEXT )
    reject_declaration ( TEXT )
    reject_comment ( TEXT )
    reject_process ( TEXT )

WHITELIST INITIALIZATION METHODS
    The filter refers to various whitelists to determine which constructs
    are acceptable. To modify these whitelists, subclasses can override the
    following methods.

    Each method is called once at object initialization time, and must
    return a reference to a nested data structure. These references are
    installed into the object, and used whenever the filter needs to refer
    to a whitelist.

    The default implementations of these methods can be invoked as class
    methods.

    init_context_whitelist ()
        Returns a reference to the "Context" whitelist, which determines
        which tags may appear at each point in the document, and which other
        tags may be nested within them.

        It is a hash, and the keys are context names, such as "Flow" and
        "Inline".

        The values in the hash are hashrefs. The keys in these subhashes are
        lowercase tag names, and the values are context names, specifying
        the context that the tag provides to any other tags nested within
        it.

        The special context "EMPTY" as a value in a subhash indicates that
        nothing can be nested within that tag.

    init_attrib_whitelist ()
        Returns a reference to the "Attrib" whitelist, which determines
        which attributes each tag can have and the values that those
        attributes can take.

        It is a hash, and the keys are lowercase tag names.

        The values in the hash are hashrefs. The keys in these subhashes are
        lowercase attribute names, and the values are attribute value class
        names, which are short strings describing the type of values that
        the attribute can take, such as "color" or "number".

    init_attval_whitelist ()
        Returns a reference to the "AttVal" whitelist, which is a hash that
        maps attribute value class names from the "Attrib" whitelist to
        coderefs to subs to validate (and optionally transform) a particular
        attribute value.

        The filter calls the attribute value validation subs with the
        following parameters:

        "filter"
            A reference to the filter object.

        "tagname"
            The lowercase name of the tag in which the attribute appears.

        "attrname"
            The name of the attribute.

        "attrval"
            The attribute value found in the input document, in canonical
            form (see "CANONICAL FORM").

        The validation sub can return undef to indicate that the attribute
        should be removed from the tag, or it can return the new value for
        the attribute, in canonical form.

    init_style_whitelist ()
        Returns a reference to the "Style" whitelist, which determines which
        CSS style directives are permitted in "style" tag attributes. The
        keys are value names such as "color" and "background-color", and the
        values are class names to be used as keys into the "AttVal"
        whitelist.

    init_deinter_whitelist
        Returns a reference to the "DeInter" whitelist, which determines
        which inline tags the filter should attempt to automatically
        de-interleave if they are encountered interleaved. For example, the
        filter will transform:

          <b>hello <i>world</b> !</i>

        Into:

          <b>hello <i>world</i></b><i> !</i>

        because both "b" and "i" appear as keys in the "DeInter" whitelist.

CHARACTER DATA PROCESSING
    These methods transform attribute values and non-tag text from the input
    document into canonical form (see "CANONICAL FORM"), and transform text
    in canonical form into a suitable form for the output document.

    text_to_canonical_form ( TEXT )
        This method is used to reduce non-tag text from the input document
        to canonical form before passing it to the filter_text() method.

        The default implementation unescapes all entities that map to
        "US-ASCII" characters other than ampersand, and replaces any
        ampersands that don't form part of valid entities with "&amp;".

    quoted_to_canonical_form ( VALUE )
        This method is used to reduce attribute values quoted with
        doublequotes or singlequotes to canonical form before passing it to
        the handler subs in the "AttVal" whitelist.

        The default behavior is the same as that of
        text_to_canonical_form().

    unquoted_to_canonical_form ( VALUE )
        This method is used to reduce attribute values without quotes to
        canonical form before passing it to the handler subs in the "AttVal"
        whitelist.

        The default implementation simply replaces all ampersands with
        "&amp;", since that corresponds with the way most browsers treat
        entities in unquoted values.

    canonical_form_to_attval ( ATTVAL )
        This method is used to convert the text in canonical form returned
        by the "AttVal" handler subs to a form suitable for inclusion in
        doublequotes in the output tag.

        The default implementation runs anything that doesn't look like a
        valid entity through the escape_html_metachars() method.

    canonical_form_to_text ( TEXT )
        This method is used to convert the text in canonical form returned
        by the filter_text() method to a form suitable for inclusion in the
        output document.

        The default implementation runs anything that doesn't look like a
        valid entity through the escape_html_metachars() method.

    validate_href_attribute ( TEXT )
        If the "AllowHref" filter configuration option is set, then this
        method is used to validate "href" type attribute values. TEXT is the
        attribute value in canonical form. Returns a possibly modified
        attribute value (in canonical form) or "undef" to reject the
        attribute.

        The default implementation allows only absolute "http" and "https"
        URLs, permits port numbers and query strings, and imposes reasonable
        length limits.

    validate_src_attribute ( TEXT )
        If the "AllowSrc" filter configuration option is set, then this
        method is used to validate "src" type attribute values. TEXT is the
        attribute value in canonical form. Returns a possibly modified
        attribute value (in canonical form) or "undef" to reject the
        attribute.

        The default implementation behaves as validate_href_attribute().

OTHER METHODS TO OVERRIDE
    As well as the output, reject, init and cdata methods listed above, it
    might make sense for subclasses to override the following methods:

    filter_text ( TEXT )
        This method will be invoked to filter blocks of non-tag text in the
        input document. Both input and output are in canonical form, see
        "CANONICAL FORM".

        The default implementation does no filtering.

    escape_html_metachars ( TEXT )
        This method is used to escape all HTML metacharacters in TEXT. The
        return value must be a copy of TEXT with metacharacters escaped.

        The default implementation escapes a minimal set of metacharacters
        for security against XSS vulnerabilities. The set of characters to
        escape is a compromise between the need for security and the need to
        ensure that the filter will work for documents in as many different
        character sets as possible.

        Subclasses which make strong assumptions about the document
        character set will be able to escape much more aggressively.

    strip_nonprintable ( TEXT )
        Returns a copy of TEXT with runs of nonprintable characters replaced
        with spaces or some other harmless string. Avoids replacing anything
        with the empty string, as that can lead to other security issues.

        The default implementation strips out only NULL characters, in order
        to avoid scrambling text for as many different character sets as
        possible.

        Subclasses which make some sort of assumption about the character
        set in use will be able to have a much wider definition of a
        nonprintable character, and hence a more secure strip_nonprintable()
        implementation.

ATTRIBUTE VALUE HANDLER SUBS
    References to the following subs appear in the "AttVal" whitelist
    returned by the init_attval_whitelist() method.

    _hss_attval_style( FILTER, TAGNAME, ATTRNAME, ATTRVAL )
        Attribute value hander for the "style" attribute.

    _hss_attval_size ( FILTER, TAGNAME, ATTRNAME, ATTRVAL )
        Attribute value handler for attributes who's values are some sort of
        size or length.

    _hss_attval_number ( FILTER, TAGNAME, ATTRNAME, ATTRVAL )
        Attribute value handler for attributes who's values are a simple
        integer.

    _hss_attval_color ( FILTER, TAGNAME, ATTRNAME, ATTRVAL )
        Attribute value handler for color attributes.

    _hss_attval_text ( FILTER, TAGNAME, ATTRNAME, ATTRVAL )
        Attribute value handler for text attributes.

    _hss_attval_word ( FILTER, TAGNAME, ATTRNAME, ATTRVAL )
        Attribute value handler for attributes who's values must consist of
        a single short word, with minus characters permitted.

    _hss_attval_wordlist ( FILTER, TAGNAME, ATTRNAME, ATTRVAL )
        Attribute value handler for attributes who's values must consist of
        one or more words, separated by spaces and/or commas.

    _hss_attval_wordlistq ( FILTER, TAGNAME, ATTRNAME, ATTRVAL )
        Attribute value handler for attributes who's values must consist of
        one or more words, separated by commas, with optional doublequotes
        around words and spaces allowed within the doublequotes.

    _hss_attval_href ( FILTER, TAGNAME, ATTRNAME, ATTRVAL )
        Attribute value handler for "href" type attributes. If the
        "AllowHref" configuration option is set, uses the
        validate_href_attribute() method to check the attribute value.

    _hss_attval_src ( FILTER, TAGNAME, ATTRNAME, ATTRVAL )
        Attribute value handler for "src" type attributes. If the "AllowSrc"
        configuration option is set, uses the validate_src_attribute()
        method to check the attribute value.

    _hss_attval_stylesrc ( FILTER, TAGNAME, ATTRNAME, ATTRVAL )
        Attribute value handler for "src" type style pseudo attributes.

    _hss_attval_novalue ( FILTER, TAGNAME, ATTRNAME, ATTRVAL )
        Attribute value handler for attributes that have no value or a value
        that is ignored. Just returns the attribute name as the value.

CANONICAL FORM
    Many of the methods described above deal with text from the input
    document, encoded in what I call "canonical form", defined as follows:

    All characters other than ampersands represent themselves. Literal
    ampersands are encoded as "&amp;". Non "US-ASCII" characters may appear
    as literals in whatever character set is in use, or they may appear as
    named or numeric HTML entities such as "&aelig;", "&#31337;" and
    "&#xFF;". Unknown named entities such as "&foo;" may appear.

    The idea is to be able to be able to reduce input text to a minimal
    form, without making too many assumptions about the character set in
    use.

PRIVATE METHODS
    The following methods are internal to this class, and should not be
    invoked from elsewhere. Subclasses should not use or override these
    methods.

    _hss_decode_numeric ( NUMERIC )
        Returns the string that should replace the numeric entity NUMERIC in
        the text_to_canonical_form() method.

    _hss_tag_is_banned ( TAGNAME )
        Returns true if the lower case tag name TAGNAME is on the list of
        harmless tags that the filter is configured to block, false
        otherwise.

    _hss_get_to_valid_context ( TAG )
        Tries to get the filter to a context in which the tag TAG is
        allowed, by introducing extra end tags or start tags if necessary.
        TAG can be either the lower case name of a tag or the string
        'CDATA'.

        Returns 1 if an allowed context is reached, or 0 if there's no
        reasonable way to get to an allowed context and the tag should just
        be rejected.

    _hss_close_innermost_tag ()
        Closes the innermost open tag.

    _hss_context ()
        Returns the current named context of the filter.

    _hss_valid_in_context ( TAG, CONTEXT )
        Returns true if the lowercase tag name TAG is valid in context
        CONTEXT, false otherwise.

    _hss_valid_in_current_context ( TAG )
        Returns true if the lowercase tag name TAG is valid in the filter's
        current context, false otherwise.

BUGS
    *   This module does a lot of work to ensure that tags are correctly
        nested and are not left open, causing unnecessary overhead for
        applications where that doesn't matter.

        Such applications may benefit from using the more lightweight
        HTML::Scrubber::StripScripts module instead.
