Using HTML::StripScripts directly
---------------------------------

HTML::StripScripts expects a stream of tokens.  Normally, to parse HTML, you
would use HTML::StripScripts::Parser or HTML::StripScripts::LibXML.

If, however, you are generating the tags yourself, and want to use
HTML::StripScripts directly, you need to pass it the tokens in order.

Look at examples/direct/direct.pl for an example of how to do this.

To run the example, type:

   perl examples/direct/direct.pl

This script passes <ul> and <li> tags, along with one bad </li> tag, ie there is
no corresponding opening <li>, so this tag is filtered.
