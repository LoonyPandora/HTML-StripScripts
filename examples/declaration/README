Overriding HTML::StripScripts to allow DDTs (Document Type Declarations)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Document Type Declaration is the first line of an HTML (or X-HTML) document
which describes the particular version of HTML that will be used in the
document. (See http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/global.html#h-7.2)

For instance, strict HTML 4.01 has this declaration:

    <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"
    "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">

By default, DTDs are rejected by HTML::StripScripts.  If you would like to
accept them, you will need to subclass HTML::StripScripts
(or HTML::StripScripts::Parser) to allow them.

IMPORTANT: More than just allowing them, you should also check the values that
           are passed in.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To run the example:

 - change to the examples/declaration directory:

     cd examples/declaration

 - then type:

     perl declaration.pl

The example parses the same HTML, first with HTML::StripScripts::Parser, then
with MyStripScripts (a subclass of HTML::StripScripts::Parser) and prints out
the two versions.

No checking of the values is done.

The example script requires HTML::StripScripts::Parser to work.
