Overriding HTML::StripScripts to add tags
-----------------------------------------

The allowed tags and attributes in HTML::StripScripts is not complete. Unsafe
tags have been specifically left out (eg <script>).

If, however, you would like to add certain tags or attributes into the allowed
list, then you will need to override HTML::StripScripts (or
HTML::StripScripts::Parser).

In this example, I add the <meta> and <link> tags into tags allowed under
the <head> tag.

WARNING: Both of these tags are potentially DANGEROUS. So think very carefully
before you allow them. Imagine, for example:

  <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;url=http://hackme.com" />

After enabling these tags, you will be able to filter them with Rules, for
instance:

   $f = MyStripScripts->new({
      Rules => { meta => \&check_meta_tags },
   });

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this example, I override the tag definitions in MyStripScripts.

To run the example:

 - change to the examples/tags directory:

     cd examples/tags

 - then type:

     perl tags.pl

The example parses the same HTML, first with HTML::StripScripts::Parser, then
with MyStripScripts (a subclass of HTML::StripScripts::Parser) and prints out
the two versions.

No checking of the values is done.

The example script requires HTML::StripScripts::Parser to work.
